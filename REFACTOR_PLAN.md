```

### 🚨 Identified Inconsistencies

#### 1. Naming Conventions
- **Components**: Mixed PascalCase/camelCase folders
- **Files**: Inconsistent use of kebab-case vs camelCase
- **Hooks**: Some use "use-" prefix, others don't
- **Utils**: No clear categorization

#### 2. State Management Patterns
- **Multiple patterns**: useState, Zustand, Context, localStorage
- **No clear separation**: Business logic mixed with UI state
- **Inconsistent error handling**: Different patterns across components

#### 3. Component Composition
- **Monolithic components**: Some components are too large
- **Mixed concerns**: UI logic mixed with business logic
- **Inconsistent patterns**: Different ways of handling similar problems
