# Keyboard Navigation Test Plan

This document provides a structured approach for testing keyboard navigation across the dashboard components. These tests should be performed regularly as part of accessibility testing to ensure all users can navigate the interface effectively without a mouse.

## Prerequisites

- Chrome browser with DevTools Accessibility Inspector
- Keyboard with Tab, Arrow keys, Enter, Space, and Escape keys
- Basic familiarity with keyboard navigation patterns

## Test Environment Setup

1. Open the application in Chrome
2. Open Chrome DevTools (F12 or Right-click > Inspect)
3. Go to the "Accessibility" tab
4. In the left sidebar of the Accessibility pane, select "Keyboard"

## Test Categories

### 1. Tab Order Tests

**Purpose**: Verify that the tab order follows a logical sequence matching the visual layout

**Procedure**:
- Start with focus on the address bar
- Press Tab repeatedly and observe focus movement
- Note the sequence of focused elements

**Pass Criteria**:
- Tab order follows visual layout (generally left to right, top to bottom)
- No interactive elements are skipped
- Focus doesn't get trapped in any element
- Tab order is consistent with the visual importance of elements

**Dashboard Areas to Test**:
- Dashboard header and navigation
- MetricsCards component
- ClientsTable component
- Filter controls 
- DataSyncMonitor component
- All modal dialogs

### 2. Interactive Element Reachability

**Purpose**: Ensure all interactive elements can be reached using the keyboard

**Procedure**:
- Tab through the entire interface
- List any elements that can be clicked with a mouse but cannot be focused with Tab

**Pass Criteria**:
- All buttons, links, form controls, and interactive widgets are keyboard-focusable
- No interactive elements require mouse-only interaction

**Dashboard Areas to Test**:
- Dropdown menus in tables
- Filter toggles
- Data visualization controls
- All buttons in client list
- Modal dialog controls

### 3. Complex Widget Operability

**Purpose**: Verify that complex interactive components can be fully operated using keyboard

**Procedure**:
- For each complex widget:
  1. Navigate to it using Tab
  2. Test relevant keyboard interactions (Space, Enter, Arrow keys)
  3. Verify expected behavior occurs

**Component-Specific Tests**:

**Data Tables**:
- Tab to table headers (should be able to focus for sorting)
- Tab to cells with interactive controls
- Test row selection with Space
- Test action buttons with Enter

**Dropdowns**:
- Tab to dropdown trigger
- Press Enter to open dropdown
- Use Arrow keys to navigate options
- Press Enter to select option
- Press Escape to dismiss without selection

**Modal Dialogs**:
- Tab to trigger button and press Enter
- Verify focus moves into the dialog
- Tab through all controls in the dialog
- Test closing with Escape key
- Verify focus returns to the trigger element after closing

**Form Controls**:
- Tab to form inputs
- Test input with keyboard
- Tab to buttons
- Test submission with Enter

### 4. Focus Visibility

**Purpose**: Ensure focused elements have a visible focus indicator

**Procedure**:
- Tab to each interactive element
- Observe the visual focus indicator

**Pass Criteria**:
- All focused elements have a clearly visible focus indicator
- Focus indicator has sufficient contrast (at least 3:1 ratio)
- Focus indicator is visible in both light and dark themes

**Things to Look For**:
- Buttons should show an outline, glow, or change color when focused
- Text inputs should display a visible cursor and focus outline
- Custom components maintain visible focus states

## Using Chrome's Accessibility Inspector

1. While testing, keep the Chrome DevTools Accessibility panel open
2. In the Accessibility pane with "Keyboard" selected, issues will be highlighted automatically
3. The "Tab Order" view shows the sequence of elements in tab order
4. The "Focus" section shows details about the currently focused element

## Documenting Issues

For each issue found, document:

1. Component/page where the issue occurs
2. Specific element that fails the test
3. Expected behavior
4. Actual behavior
5. Steps to reproduce
6. Screenshot showing the issue (if applicable)

## Keyboard Shortcuts Reference

Common keyboard controls to test:

- **Tab**: Move forward through focusable elements
- **Shift+Tab**: Move backward through focusable elements
- **Enter**: Activate buttons, links, submit forms
- **Space**: Toggle checkboxes, radio buttons, activate buttons
- **Arrow keys**: Navigate within components (e.g., dropdown options, table cells)
- **Escape**: Close modals, cancel operations
- **Home/End**: Navigate to first/last items in a list
- **Page Up/Down**: Scroll the page

## Critical User Flows to Test

1. Navigating the dashboard header and main content areas
2. Filtering and sorting client tables
3. Opening and interacting with client details
4. Completing form submissions
5. Managing data visualization controls

This test plan should be updated as new components are added or existing components are modified.
