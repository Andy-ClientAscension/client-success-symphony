```

## 📊 **Expected Results After Fix**

### ✅ **Before (Broken Experience)**

## 🎯 **AI Bot Capabilities Once Working**

The AI assistant (Maya) is designed as a Senior Business Intelligence Analyst that can:

- **📈 Revenue Analytics**: MRR forecasting, cohort analysis
- **👥 Customer Intelligence**: Churn prediction, health scoring
- **📋 Strategic Planning**: Executive reporting, KPI dashboards
- **⚙️ Operational Excellence**: Process automation, efficiency
- **🎯 Market Intelligence**: Competitive analysis, trends

### Example Questions You Can Ask:
- "What clients are at risk of churning this month?"
- "Which accounts have the highest growth potential?"
- "Generate an executive summary of our client health"

- "Recommend actions to improve client retention"

## 🔧 **Technical Improvements Made**

1. **Better API Integration**: More robust error handling for OpenRouter API
2. **User Onboarding**: Clear setup flow instead of silent failures
3. **Status Indicators**: Visual feedback on configuration and connection status
4. **Error Recovery**: Helpful error messages with actionable next steps
5. **Testing Tools**: Built-in API key validation and testing

The AI bot should now provide real value instead of being a broken feature that confuses users.
