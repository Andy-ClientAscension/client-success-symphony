# 🚀 Production Deployment Guide

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Environment Configuration
1. **Copy environment template**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.production.template .env.production.local
   ```

2. **Configure production values**:
   - ✅ `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Already configured
   - ✅ `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Already configured  
   - ⚠️ `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`: Set your Sentry DSN for error tracking
   - ⚠️ `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: Set to your production domain

### ✅ Supabase Security Hardening

#### Required Actions in Supabase Dashboard:
1. **Navigate to Authentication > Settings**
2. **Fix OTP Settings**:
   - Set OTP expiry to 600 seconds (10 minutes) or less
3. **Enable Password Protection**:
   - Turn ON "Check password against known breaches"
4. **Review RLS Policies**:
   - All tables have appropriate Row Level Security enabled
   - Policies are restrictive and secure

### ✅ Error Tracking Setup

#### Get Sentry DSN:
1. Create account at [sentry.io](https://sentry.io)
2. Create new React project
3. Copy DSN from project settings
4. Add to `.env.production.local`

### ✅ Performance Monitoring

The application includes built-in monitoring for:
- ✅ Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID, etc.)
- ✅ Performance metrics
- ✅ User interactions
- ✅ Error tracking

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy with Lovable (Recommended)
1. Click **"Publish"** button in Lovable
2. Configure custom domain if needed
3. Environment variables are handled automatically

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
1. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy static files**:
   - Upload `dist/` folder to your hosting provider
   - Configure routing for SPA (redirect all routes to index.html)

3. **Configure environment variables** on your hosting platform

## Post-Deployment Verification

### ✅ Functionality Tests
- [ ] User login/logout works
- [ ] Dashboard loads correctly
- [ ] Client data displays
- [ ] Real-time updates function
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

### ✅ Performance Tests
- [ ] Page load time < 3 seconds
- [ ] Core Web Vitals pass
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Error tracking works

### ✅ Security Tests
- [ ] Authentication required for protected routes
- [ ] RLS policies enforce data access
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] No sensitive data in browser console

## Monitoring Setup

### Production Dashboards
1. **Supabase Dashboard**: Database metrics and logs
2. **Sentry Dashboard**: Error rates and performance
3. **Hosting Dashboard**: Uptime and response times

### Alert Thresholds
- **Error Rate**: > 1%
- **Response Time**: > 3 seconds
- **Uptime**: < 99.5%

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Environment variables not found"
- Ensure `.env.production.local` exists
- Check variable names match exactly
- Restart build process

#### "Supabase connection failed"
- Verify URLs and keys in Supabase dashboard
- Check network connectivity
- Review CORS settings

#### "Sentry not receiving errors"
- Verify DSN is correct
- Check beforeSend filter in development
- Ensure production environment is set

### Support Contacts
- **Technical Issues**: Contact development team
- **Hosting Issues**: Contact hosting provider
- **Database Issues**: Check Supabase status page

## Security Considerations

### ✅ Implemented
- Row Level Security on all tables
- Authentication required for sensitive operations
- CORS headers configured
- Input validation on all forms
- Error boundaries prevent crashes

### 🔒 Additional Recommendations
- Regular security audits
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Review user permissions quarterly
- Keep dependencies updated
